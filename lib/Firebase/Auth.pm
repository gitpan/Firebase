=head1 NAME

Firebase::Auth - Auth token generation for firebase.com.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.0002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Firebase::Auth;
 
 my $token = Firebase::Auth->new(token => 'xxxxxxxxx', admin => 'true', data => { uid => '1' } )->create_token();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl class to generate auth tokens for L<http://www.firebase.com>. See L<https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/custom-login.html> for details on the spec.
    
    
=head1 METHODS


=head2 new

Constructor.

=over

=item data

Optional. If you don't specify this, then you need to specify it when you call create_token(). This should be a hash reference of all the data you want to pass for user data. This data will be available as the C<auth> object in Firebase's security rules. If you do specify it, then it must have a C<uid> key that contain's the users unique user id, which must be a non-null string that is no longer than 256 characters.

=item secret

Required. The api secret token provided by firebase.com.

=item admin

Defaults to C<\0>. If set to C<\1> (a reference to zero or one) then full access will be granted for this token.

=item debug

Defaults to C<\0>. If set to C<\1> (a reference to zero or one) then verbose error messages will be returned from service calls.

B<NOTE:> To access debug info, call C<debug> on the L<Firebase> object after making a request.

=item expires

An epoch date. Defaults to expiring 24 hours from the issued date.

=item not_before

An epoch date. The opposite of C<expires>. Defaults to now. The token will not be valid until after this date.

=item token_version

Defaults to C<0>.

=item token_separator

Defaults to C<.>

=back


=head2 urlbase64_encode

URL base-64 encodes a string, and then does some minor translation on it to make it compatible with Firebase.

=over

=item string

The string to encode.

=back




=head2 create_token

Generates a signed token. This is probably the only method you'll ever need to call besides the constructor.

=over

=item data

Required if not specified in constructor. Defaults to the C<data> element in the constructor. A hash reference of parameters you wish to pass to the service. If specified it must have a C<uid> key that contain's the users unique user id, which must be a non-null string that is no longer than 256 characters. 

=back



=head2 create_claims

Generates a list of claims based upon the options provided to the constructor. 

=over

=item data

Required. A hash reference of user data you wish to pass to the service. It must have a C<uid> key that contain's the users unique user id, which must be a non-null string that is no longer than 256 characters.

=back



=head2 encode_token

Encodes, signs, and formats the data into a token.

=over

=item claims

Required. A list of claims as created by C<create_claims>

=back


=head2 sign

Generates a signature based upon a string of data.

=over

=item string

A string to sign.

=back



=head1 EXCEPTIONS

This module may L<Ouch> exceptions.

=head2 missing param

This will be thrown if a required parameter was not set. For example the C<uid> key in the C<data> payload.

=head2 param out of range

This will be thrown if a parameter is outside it's acceptable range. For example the C<uid> key in the C<data> payload.
